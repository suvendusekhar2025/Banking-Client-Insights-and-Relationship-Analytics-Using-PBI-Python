# Banking-Client-Insights-and-Relationship-Analytics-Using-PBI-Python


üìä Project Overview: Banking Client Insights and Relationship Analytics
This analytics project is designed to explore and visualize client behaviors, demographics, and financial relationships within a banking environment. Through a combination of data exploration in Python and dashboard visualization in Power BI, the project delivers comprehensive insights aimed at driving strategic decisions for customer engagement, investment advisory, and relationship management.

üîç Objective
The core objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of banking clients and their financial relationships by:

Analyzing demographic and behavioral trends,

Identifying key patterns in client-investment relationships,

Segmenting clients based on meaningful attributes,

Presenting the results via a user-friendly, interactive dashboard.

üß∞ Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI was used to build a rich and dynamic dashboard that visualizes critical KPIs and client trends. The .pbix file integrates cleaned datasets and transforms them into actionable insights through graphs, filters, and custom visuals.

Python (Jupyter Notebook) served as the analytical backbone for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, raw data was cleaned, merged, and visualized for deeper statistical insight.

CSV Files formed the foundational data sources, each capturing different aspects of the banking system:

banking-clients.csv: client-level demographic and financial info

banking-realtionships.csv: advisor-client and investment mappings

gender.csv, investment-advisors.csv: supplemental data for enrichment

üß™ Steps Followed in the Project
Data Collection and Integration

Multiple CSV files were imported and analyzed to ensure completeness and consistency.

Merging of client and relationship data enabled a unified view of each client‚Äôs profile and financial activity.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formats were identified and resolved in Python.

Variables were standardized and categorical fields (like gender) were encoded or grouped appropriately.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive statistics, distribution plots, and correlation heatmaps helped identify patterns and outliers.

Grouped aggregations were used to explore trends across advisor performance, investment behavior, and client demographics.

Dashboard Design in Power BI

The refined data was imported into Power BI to create a visual summary.

Filters (e.g., gender, investment type), slicers, and trend graphs allow end-users to explore data interactively.

KPIs such as client count, total investments, and advisor performance were prominently highlighted.

üìà Learning Outcome for Users
This project serves as an end-to-end blueprint for performing a real-world data analytics case study in the banking domain. By walking through this project, users will learn:

How to merge and preprocess multi-source datasets in Python

Techniques for performing EDA and deriving meaningful insights

How to transition from raw data to visualization-ready datasets

Best practices in dashboard design using Power BI

The value of data storytelling and visual analytics in driving decisions
